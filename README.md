# Buildapcsales-Twitter-Bot

## This script allows for the searching of various keywords on the reddit.com/r/buildapcsales forum. Returning these indivudal posts, they are then written onto a .txt file on separate lines along with the link to the sale. Furthermore, the script then acts as a Twitter bot and tweets each sale in individual tweets, allowing for notification of specific sales and providing the direct link to that sale.

### Utilizes both Twitter and Reddit API's. Furthermore, the Tweepy library is used to more easily interact and access the Twitter API. In the reddit.py file, my specific twitter and reddit keys/secrets are replaced with dummy strings. For use of the bot, new keys and secrets are needed.
